## **Disclaimers**
src directory in base is redundant but for some reason trying to delete it on local causes some issues, so I'm keeping it there for now. But it's just our earliest version of this game - IA


#### HOW TO USE:
- Download the zip folder inside of Game_Project/Corebellyn/newfinalproject.zip
- Import into godot
- Enjoy!


## **Description**
OUr final project designed in godot to be a 2D turn combat style game with some fun mechanics.


### Naming Convention:
Corebelyn (Corebellyn?) - working "stable" version of the godot game implementation - headed by Colotn Coughlin & John Cordwell III

    Included in our stable release are some of the following features:
        - Working dictionaries and vectors/2D vectors. 
        - Function turn base manager
        - Smooth movements
        - Interactive buttons
        - Detailed Game world
        - Start Menus
        - Attack, Run, Defend Options
        - Party and Enemy Systems

Trames-Adventura - lots of theoretical work that either never fully integrated or got too ambitious for the project - headed by Isaac Abella

    Included in Trames-Adventura are some of the theoretical scripts
        - Procedural Generation for weapons, dictionary stats, and character classes
        - Abstract class creation for player characters
        - Custom vector sorts - (Superseded by turns manager used in Corebelyn)
        - Inventory System
        - Weapon System - (Simple attack feature favored instead)
        - Combat System 1.0 (Deeper combat logic)
        - Experience System
    

### Big Changes to our repo so far:
    Lots of rebasing - i.e: removing lots of dead end submodules, adding in readmes, cleaning up directories that didn't have much explanation. 


### Going forward:

    Finish up manager end sequence for when health bars go to to 0 for either enemy or player health
    Attempt last minute procedural generation on terrain using png files since they look so cool.
