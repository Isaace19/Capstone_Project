# Capstone_Project

Final Project for CS302

Recent Changes - Using New Names for project: Trames Adventura and Corbelyn

Changes to Code: 
*   Rebasing github to included a Depcrated Assets of our initial coding to 2D nodes.
        New Code has dedicated directories to new character and word files that will extend to use similar scripts for modularity. 
        New Code should also include a Procedural Generation Script that is in progress. We are planning to implement 
        a new weighted system that will include different outomces depending on the current conditions of each character.

My goals so far for the project:
*   Implement a working XP system. 
*   Attach dictionary stats to at least 3 - 5 characters - than make a weighted system of procedurally generating     stats
*   Create a vector sorter to use compare dictionaries stored into a vector of characters
* Implement Newton Fractals or Perlin Noise for world generation
